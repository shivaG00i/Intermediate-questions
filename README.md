### ‚úÖ What You'll Practice:

* List and dictionary traversal
* Data aggregation and transformation
* Role-based grouping
* Sorting and filtering logic
* Real-world planning, resource, and reporting tasks

| `summarize_work(...)`          | Aggregates daily work logs into total bricks per worker               |
| `filter_high_performers(...)`  | Filters workers whose total output exceeds a given threshold          |
| `calculate_material_cost(...)` | Computes total cost based on unit prices and quantities               |
| `sort_workers_by_output(...)`  | Sorts workers descending by total output                              |
| `group_by_role(...)`           | Groups worker names under their respective roles                      |
| `compare_material_needs(...)`  | Compares material needs across two sites and reports which needs more |
